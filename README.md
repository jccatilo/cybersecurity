# Welcome to my cybersecurity repository
> The contents of this branch are just compilations of my notes during the random times when I want to learn cybersecurity.

There are certain skills/knowledge we need to know when entering the world/career of cybersecurity:

- Basic IT Skills
- Linux Fundamentals
- Networking Refresher
- Coding Skills

 > Note: You do not have to be experts on the subjects above but are edge when you want to fully understand the necessary concepts. :)
 > Certificates aren't necessary. Knowledge and experience is free. But certificates are expensive. ;(

## Basic IT kills

- CompTIA certificates: Certification is not required; only the knowledge.
- Professer Messer's CompTIA A+. [Core 1](https://www.professormesser.com/free-a-plus-training/a-plus-videos/220-1001-training-course/), [Core 2](https://www.professormesser.com/free-a-plus-training/a-plus-videos/220-1002-training-course/)

## Linux Fundamentals

- [linuxjourney](https://www.linuxjourney.com): Really take time to go through the topics. You will thank me later.
- [overthewire](https:///www.overthewire.org): do this just to have some fun and be familiar with common linux terminal commands.

## Networking

- CompTIA Network+: Certification is not required; only the knowledge.
- Free [Professor Messer's CompTIA Network+ Videos](https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-008/n10-008-video/n10-008-training-course/)
- CCNA. Again, certification is not required; only the knowledge.
- You can refer to my repo above called "[Networking Refresher](https://github.com/jccatilo/cybersecurity/tree/main/Networking%20refresher)" to know some basic concepts like IP addresses, the OSI Layer, common ports and protocols, and what not that I think you will encounter in the learning stages of cyber security / ethical hacking

## Coding Skills

- you don't need to be a real software developer for cyber security
- knowing how to read code will help when you are going to use some tools that have some level of automation and soon create your own tools and scripts.
- Give focus on [bash scripting](https://github.com/jccatilo/cybersecurity/tree/main/Scripting) and [python](https://github.com/jccatilo/python_updated).
- codecademy, teamtreahouse, freecodecamp, etc.
